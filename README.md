# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Using-Cox-Regression
An example of using the Lifelines package (in Python) to analyze customer churn

I decided to update my knowledge of Survival Analysis by exploring the Lifelines package in Python. The dataset I'm analyzing is dummy customer data with the goal of predicting attrition. 

Steps include:
1. Data cleaning
2. EDA
3. Preprocessing
4. Hyperparameter selection
5. Implementation of Cox Regression
